#  California Housing Prices Deep Neural Network
*Deep Learning Project - Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid.    
Building a deep ANN for classification task in Python.*

## Overview 
In this work is performed the whole process to build a deep neural network from scratch.   The goal is to classify the observations of MedianHouseValue dataset in one of the 4 classes that describe the approximate locations of a house in California: Near Bay, Less than 1 Hour from the Ocean, Inland and Near the Ocean.
Several nets have been built to select the one that performs better according the accuracy value and the balance between bias and variance.  
Batch normalization, L1/L2 Regularizers and Initializer are also used to improve results.
