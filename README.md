# Deep Neural Networks for California Housing Prices
*Deep Learning Project - Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid.    
California Housing Prices classification task using a Deep ANN in Python.*

## Overview 
In this work is performed the whole process to build a deep neural network from scratch.   The goal is to classify the observations of MedianHouseValue dataset in one of the 4 classes that describe the approximate locations of a house in California.  
Several nets have been built to select the one that performs better according the accuracy value and the balance between bias and variance.  
  
Batch normalization, L1/L2 Regularizers and Initializer are also used to improve results.
